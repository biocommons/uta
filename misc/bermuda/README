This directory contains code to generate data for the Bermuda document.
The Bermuda document provides a 3-way comparison of genomic sequences
(chromosomes and patches), RefSeq transcripts, and ENST transcripts. 

The genome-RefSeq comparisons allow users to account for discrepancies
between the GRCh37 primary assembly used for alignment and RefSeq
transcripts used for reporting.  These discrepancies include natural
variation and sequence errors.

The RefSeq-Ensembl comparisons allow users to determine the equivalence of
RefSeq and Ensembl transcripts.



Instructions:

1) Build UTA as described elsewhere.

2) Build and load the nm_enst_equivs table.
a) ./bin/bermuda-nm-enst-equivs >|nm_enst_equivs.tsv
b) psql
\i nm-enst-equivs.sql
\copy nm-enst-equivs from 'nm-enst-equivs.tsv' delimiter '	'
(that's a tab between the single quotes)

3) Build and load the HGMD transcript table
a) MYSQL_PWD='(your pass here)' mysql -h db.host.com -B  -e 'select gene as hgnc,refseq as ac from hgmd_pro.allgenes' >hgmd-gene-transcripts.tsv
b) psql
\i hgmd-gene-transcripts.sql
\copy hgmd_gene_transcripts from misc/bermuda/hgmd-gene-transcripts.tsv delimiter '     ' csv header null 'NULL';
