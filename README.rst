UTR -- Universal Transcript Repository
======================================

--------
Overview
--------

The UTR stores transcripts aligned to genome reference assemblies using
multiple methods.  It is intended to address these issues:

  - enabling an interpretation of variants reported in literature against
    obsolete transcript records
  - identifying regions where transcript and reference genome sequence
    assemblies disagree
  - characterizing the differences between transcripts of the same gene
  - projecting ("lifting over") variants from one transcript to another
  - identifying transcripts and genomic regions with ambiguous alignments
    that may affect clinical interpretation
  - rapid querying of multiple transcript sources through a single
    interface
