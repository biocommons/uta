populate __version__ and hg_id

Two cases:
1) Try to fetch SCM info by running 'hg id'.  This case applies
   mostly to development code.
2) If that fails, look for _release.py.
   _release.py is created during packaging, but is NOT added in hg.
   Therefore, this case applies mostly to deployed code.
