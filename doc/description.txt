The UTA stores transcripts aligned to genome reference assemblies using
multiple methods in order to improve the precision and accuracy by which
the scientific and clinical communities describe variants.

It will facilitate the following:

* enabling an interpretation of variants reported in literature against
  obsolete transcript records
* identifying regions where transcript and reference genome sequence
  assemblies disagree
* characterizing transcripts of the same gene across transcript sources
* identifying transcripts and genomic regions with ambiguous alignments
  that may affect clinical interpretation
* querying for multiple transcript sources through a single
  interface
